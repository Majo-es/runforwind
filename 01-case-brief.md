# 01 — Case Brief: Runforwind S.A.

## Company Profile

**Runforwind S.A.** is a Barcelona-based company founded in 2010, specialising in the manufacture, marketing, and distribution of technical sportswear for trail running. With a workforce of 20 people, the company has established itself as one of the leading emerging brands in the Catalan sports sector.

Exports account for over **60% of total revenue**, with France and Italy as its primary international markets — both outperforming domestic Spanish sales. The company has experience in offline export channels (ISPO trade fair in Munich, country-based sales agents) but is now pursuing a structured digital internationalisation strategy.

## Value Proposition

Runforwind's offer is built on three pillars:

**1. Technical Design & Functionality**  
Ultralight fabrics, waterproof and windproof technologies, ergonomic cuts optimised for long-distance mountain running. Products are designed specifically for semi-professional and professional runners where performance, weight, and durability are decisive purchase criteria.

**2. In-House Manufacturing & Proximity**  
Full control of the production process allows rapid iteration on new designs, small-batch customisation, and compliance with European quality standards. This enables real-time trend integration and dynamic market feedback adaptation.

**3. Authentic Brand Identity**  
While not yet internationally recognised at scale, Runforwind has cultivated a loyal community in Spain through elite runner sponsorships (Jordi Pons, Marta Torres) who act as brand ambassadors. Presence at European trail running competitions has built niche-sector recognition.
