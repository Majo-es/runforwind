## Google Ads (SEM)

### Campaign Structure

**Campaign 1: Google Shopping (Performance Max)**
- Feed: product titles, descriptions, images optimised for UK queries
- Bid strategy: Target ROAS (start at 2x, optimise up)
- Priority SKUs: Trail jacket + hydration pack
- Negative keywords: "cheap", "budget", "discount"

- Bid on competitor terms (Inov-8 alternatives, Alpkit alternatives)

**Campaign 3: Retargeting (Display + YouTube)**
- 30-day cookie window
- Creative: product-focused + social proof (reviews, "Made in Barcelona")
- Exclude: converted customers (send to email)

### SEM Budget & KPIs

| Metric | Target (Month 6) | Target (Month 12) |
|---|---|---|
| Monthly clicks | 500 | 1,500 |
| CPC average | £0.80–1.20 | £0.60–1.00 |
| Conversion rate | 1.5% | 2.5% |
| ROAS | 2x | 3.5x |

**Budget:** €5,000 over 12 months (front-loaded: €800/month Months 1–6, €400/month Months 7–12 as organic grows)

---

## Social Media

### Platform Strategy

**Instagram (Priority 1)**
- Content mix: 60% lifestyle/editorial, 30% product, 10% community/UGC
- Reels focus: trail running adventure content, behind-the-scenes manufacturing
- Stories: product drops, polls, UK race event coverage
- Hashtag clusters: #trailrunninguk #ultrarunning #trailrunner #outdooruk #hikinguk

**TikTok (Priority 2 — Growing Channel)**
- Format: short educational content ("how to choose a trail jacket"), challenges, race coverage
- Trending audio + trail content has strong organic reach
- Target 18–35 age bracket entering the sport

**Paid Social Budget Allocation**

| Channel | Monthly Budget | Format |
|---|---|---|
| Instagram Ads | €300 | Reels + Stories |
| TikTok Ads | €100 | In-Feed Video |
| Facebook Retargeting | €50 | Carousel |

**Total Paid Social:** €5,400 across 12 months (scaled up in peak seasons: Oct–Nov, Jan–Feb)

### UK Influencer / Ambassador Plan

| Tier | Profile | Budget | Deliverable |
|---|---|---|---|
| Micro (10K–50K) | UK trail runners | Product gifting | 3 posts + stories |
| Mid (50K–150K) | UK endurance athletes | €300–500/collab | Reel + review |
| Macro (150K+) | Only if organic alignment | Negotiated | Campaign partnership |

**Avoid paid mega-influencers** — UK trail running community values authenticity over celebrity. Micro-influencers with genuine running credentials outperform.

## Email Marketing

5. Social follow request + UGC invite

1. Reminder at 1 hour — product shown, no incentive
2. Follow-up at 24 hours — add social proof (reviews)
3. Final at 72 hours — free shipping reminder if applicable

**Flow 3: Post-Purchase**
1. Order confirmation + Brexit/customs explainer (reassurance)
2. Delivery tracking + what to expect
3. 14 days post-delivery: review request (Trustpilot + Google)
4. 30 days: reorder/cross-sell (complementary products)

**Flow 4: B2B Lead Nurture**
1. Initial contact acknowledgement + brand deck
2. Follow-up: product samples offer
3. Case study / Runnersneed pilot results
4. Proposal / terms sheet

**Budget:** €2,000 (platform subscription — Klaviyo recommended — + setup and flow creation)
