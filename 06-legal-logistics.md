# 06 — Legal & Logistics: Brexit, VAT & E-Fulfillment

## Post-Brexit Context

Since January 2021, the UK is no longer part of the EU Customs Union or Single Market. For Runforwind, shipping from Spain to UK consumers means navigating:

- **Customs declarations** on every commercial shipment
- **Import duties** depending on product classification (HS code)
- **VAT collection** obligations under UK rules
- **Consumer protection** under UK-specific law (not EU directives)

This adds complexity and cost compared to intra-EU sales to France and Italy, but is fully manageable with the right setup.

## UK VAT — Registration & Compliance

### When to Register

| Scenario | UK VAT Required |
|---|---|
| Selling D2C via own website (goods shipped from Spain) | Yes, if sales exceed £85,000/year |
| Selling via Amazon FBA (stock held in UK warehouse) | **Yes, from Day 1** — HMRC requires VAT registration when non-UK seller stores goods in UK |
| Selling B2B to UK VAT-registered business | Usually reverse charge — buyer accounts for VAT |

**Recommendation:** Register for UK VAT proactively — it is required as soon as stock enters UK warehouses for FBA.

### UK VAT Rate
- **Standard rate: 20%** on most clothing and footwear
- Children's clothing: 0% (not applicable to Runforwind)
- No reduced rate for sports clothing

### Practical Steps
1. Apply for UK VAT registration via HMRC (hmrc.gov.uk) — allow 4–8 weeks
2. Get a UK VAT number before first FBA shipment
3. Display UK VAT number on website and invoices
4. File quarterly UK VAT returns (or appoint a UK tax agent/accountant)

## Customs & Import Duties

### HS Code Classification

Runforwind's main products fall under:

| Product | HS Code | UK Import Duty |
|---|---|---|
| Trail jackets (synthetic, waterproof) | 6201.40 / 6202.40 | 12% |
| Trail shoes | 6404.11 | 4.7% |
| Hydration packs / backpacks | 4202.92 | 2.7% |

**Note:** These rates apply on **cost + insurance + freight (CIF)** value. Duties are paid by the UK importer of record (or passed to consumer for DDP shipments).

### Landed Cost Calculation Example

```
Trail Jacket (ex-works Spain): £80
Shipping to UK:                £8
Insurance:                     £1
CIF Value:                     £89
UK Import Duty (12%):          £10.68
UK VAT (20% on CIF + duty):   £19.94
                               ───────
Total Landed Cost (UK):        £119.62
Sell for:                      £150
Gross Margin after duties:     £30.38 (20%)
```

## E-Fulfillment Strategy

Three options evaluated for Runforwind's Phase 1:

### Option A: Direct Shipping from Barcelona (DDP)

| | Detail |
|---|---|
| How it works | Ship each order individually from Spain to UK consumer |
| Courier | DHL Express, DPD, or UPS — declare DDP (Delivered Duty Paid) |
| Timeline | 3–5 business days |
| Cost | £8–15/order (weight dependent) |
| Pros | No UK warehousing cost; full inventory control |
| Cons | Higher per-order cost; customs delays possible; Brexit friction visible to customer |
| Recommended for | Low volume early phase; orders under 2kg |

### Option B: Amazon FBA UK ✅ Recommended for Phase 1

| | Detail |
|---|---|
| How it works | Send bulk stock (50–100 units) to Amazon UK warehouse; Amazon ships to customer |
| Timeline | 1–2 days (Prime) |
| Cost | FBA fee £3.50–5.50/unit + storage |
| Pros | Prime badge; fastest delivery; eliminates per-order customs; improves conversion |
| Cons | Amazon commission (15%); inventory forecast complexity |
| Recommended for | Hero SKUs with predictable demand; Phase 1–2 |

### Option C: UK 3PL (Third-Party Logistics) ✅ Recommended for Phase 2+

| | Detail |
|---|---|
| How it works | Partner with a UK fulfilment warehouse (e.g., Huboo, Huboo, Fulfilment by Huboo, James and James, Torque Logistics) |
| Timeline | 2–3 days standard |
| Cost | £1.50–3.00 pick & pack + storage |
| Pros | Full control; not Amazon-dependent; handles all SKUs |
| Cons | Setup cost; minimum volume requirements (usually 200+ orders/month) |
| Recommended for | Month 6–12 when volume justifies it |

## Consumer Protection — UK Law

Post-Brexit, the UK operates its own consumer protection framework (no longer EU Consumer Rights Directive).

### Key Obligations

**Consumer Rights Act 2015**
- Goods must be of satisfactory quality, fit for purpose, and as described
- Consumers have 30 days to reject faulty goods for full refund
- 6 months: fault presumed to exist at time of sale (seller must prove otherwise)
- Up to 6 years to claim for defective goods

**Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013**
- Right to cancel online purchases within **14 days** of receiving goods (no reason needed)
- Refund must be issued within 14 days of receiving returned goods
- Seller pays return costs if this was agreed at point of sale

**Runforwind's Policy Recommendation**
- Offer **30-day free returns** (exceeds legal minimum; matches market expectation)
- Include prepaid return label in every package
- Display full returns policy on website with a simple, friendly tone

### UK GDPR (Data Protection)
Post-Brexit, the UK has its own version of GDPR ("UK GDPR") — functionally very similar to EU GDPR but a separate legal framework.

**Required actions:**
- Separate UK Privacy Policy (reference "UK GDPR" not just "GDPR")
- UK ICO registration (Information Commissioner's Office) — required if processing UK personal data
- Cookie consent compliant with UK rules (PECR regulations)
- Data transfers from UK to Spain covered by EU-UK adequacy decision (currently in place — monitor for changes)
