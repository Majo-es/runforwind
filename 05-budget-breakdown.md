# 05 — Budget Breakdown: €30,000 Allocation

## Budget Philosophy

The €30,000 budget must serve two distinct purposes simultaneously: **one-time infrastructure investment** (website adaptation) and **12 months of ongoing marketing**. The allocation below is designed to maximise qualified traffic and B2B leads while building brand credibility from a standing start.

**Core principle:** Invest heavily in owned/earned channels (SEO, content, community) that compound over time, while using paid channels to accelerate early visibility.

## Phased Spend by Quarter

| Quarter | Focus | Budget |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 (Months 1–3) | Infrastructure + Launch | €13,000 |
| Q2 (Months 4–6) | Growth + Optimisation | €8,000 |
| Q3 (Months 7–9) | Scale + B2B Development | €5,500 |
| Q4 (Months 10–12) | Peak Season + Year Review | €3,500 |

**Q1 is deliberately heavy** — web adaptation and FBA setup are one-time costs that unlock all other channels.

## Budget Risk & Contingency Notes

**FX Risk:** EUR/GBP fluctuation affects UK pricing competitiveness. Review quarterly; update GBP prices if necessary. Contingency budget provides buffer.

**Brexit Customs Surcharges:** If unexpected duty costs arise on returns or inbound FBA shipments, contingency covers first €1,500. Beyond that, FBA pricing may need adjustment.

**Channel Under-performance:** Month 6 review is the key decision point. If Google Ads underperforms (ROAS < 1.5x), reallocate to social or SEO. Build this flexibility into agency/tool contracts.
