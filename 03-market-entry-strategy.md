# 03 — Market Entry Strategy: UK Channels

## Strategic Framework

Runforwind's UK entry combines three complementary distribution channels, each serving a distinct role in building presence, revenue, and brand credibility:

| Channel | Role | Revenue Share Target |
|---|---|---|
| Own Website (D2C) | Brand ownership, margin maximisation, data collection | 50–60% |
| Amazon.co.uk (FBA) | Discovery, volume, UK logistics solution | 20–30% |
| B2B Distributors | Credibility, retail presence, offline reach | 15–25% |

---

## Channel 1: Own E-commerce Website (D2C)

The branded website is the foundation of the strategy. It must be fully adapted for the UK market — not just translated, but localised.

### Required UK Adaptations

**Pricing & Payments**
- All prices displayed in GBP (£)
- Payment methods: Stripe, PayPal, **Klarna** (key differentiator — no competitor prominently features BNPL)
- VAT-inclusive pricing displayed clearly

**Trust & Credibility Signals**
- Trustpilot integration (with active review collection from Day 1)
- "30-Day Free Returns" badge prominently displayed
- UK customer testimonials section (build through pilot programme)
- "Made in Barcelona" / "European Manufacturing" badge — authentic differentiator
- Live chat or chatbot support

**Legal & Compliance**
- UK-specific Terms & Conditions (in British English)
- UK-compliant Privacy Policy (UK GDPR post-Brexit)
- Clear customs/duties messaging: "All taxes included — no surprise charges at delivery"
- Brexit FAQ page (How does shipping from Spain work? What about customs?)

**Shipping**
- Free shipping on orders ≥ £100
- Estimated delivery: 3–5 business days
- Full tracking provided
- Free returns within 30 days — prepaid label included in package

## Channel 2: Amazon.co.uk (FBA) — Recommended: YES

### Rationale
Amazon FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon) solves the UK logistics problem elegantly: stock is held in Amazon's UK warehouses, eliminating per-order customs complexity and enabling Prime-speed delivery.

### Phase 1 FBA Plan

| Parameter | Detail |
|---|---|
| SKUs | 1–2 hero products (trail jacket priority) |
| Initial stock | 50–100 units |
| Pricing | £120–160 |
| Ads budget | €1,000 (Amazon Sponsored Products) |
| Commission | ~15% + FBA fee £3–5/unit |
| Revenue target | 20–30% of Phase 1 sales |

### Why FBA over other marketplaces

**Discarded alternatives:**
- **Sports Direct** — low-cost positioning incompatible with Runforwind's brand
- **Decathlon** — price competition would erode margins and brand perception
- **Zalando / Very** — not trail-running specialised; commission 20–30% without community value-add

## Channel 3: B2B Distribution — Highest Strategic Priority

B2B distribution provides UK logistics support, instant retail credibility, and access to existing trail running communities.

### Target Distributors — Prioritised

**Priority 1: Run4It** (run4it.com — DA 41)
- Lowest barrier to entry among all multi-brand distributors
- Specialised running retailer with dedicated trail section
- Recommended first contact — proof of concept partnership
- Terms: 40–45% retailer margin; minimum 100–200 units

**Priority 2: Runnersneed** (runnersneed.com — DA 54)
- 40+ physical stores across UK + strong e-commerce
- Semi-professional target audience aligns with Runforwind positioning
- Requires stronger brand proof — approach after Run4It relationship established
- Terms: 40–45% margin; minimum 200+ units

**Priority 3: Start Fitness** (startfitness.co.uk — DA 53)
- Strong social presence (79K Facebook, 46.6K Instagram) and 2.4M indexed pages
- General sports retailer with running category — accessible mid-tier option
- Good parallel track to Runnersneed in Phase 2

**Priority 4: Wiggle** (wiggle.co.uk — DA 72)
- Pan-European reach; dominant online sports retailer
- Highest volume potential but most selective onboarding
- Long-term objective (Months 9–12 or Phase 2)

### B2B Outreach Plan

```
Month 1-2:  Research, prepare trade deck + line sheets in GBP
Month 2-3:  First contact with Run4It — propose pilot 100-unit order
Month 4-5:  Leverage Run4It results; approach Runnersneed
Month 6-8:  Consolidate 2 distributor relationships
Month 9-12: Initiate Wiggle conversation with established UK track record
```

## Pre-Launch Brand Building (Months -2 to 0)

Before investing the full marketing budget, the following low-cost initiatives build social proof:

**UK Run Team Programme**
- Recruit 20–30 early adopter UK trail runners (via Instagram DMs, trail running Facebook groups, Strava clubs)
- Provide product samples in exchange for authentic reviews and social content
- Builds Trustpilot reviews and Instagram UGC before paid campaigns launch

**Content Series: "800km — One Jacket"**
- A content series documenting a trail runner completing the Camino de Santiago in Runforwind kit
- Speaks directly to British trail runners' values: personal challenge, nature, meaningful adventure
- Differentiates from purely competition-focused competitors
- Shareable format: Instagram Reels, YouTube, blog — generates SEO content simultaneously
